# MD5 CUDA Brute Force Analysis

## Pratham Baid

January 9, 2023


Abstract
The MD5 hash function is commonly used to verify the integrity of data, such as
the integrity of downloaded files or messages transmitted over a network. However,
the MD5 encryption scheme has been found to be vulnerable to a number of attacks
and is no longer considered secure. This project aims to highlight the vulnerabilities
of the MD5 encryption scheme by using a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to brute
force it. The project involves creating a program that takes an MD5 hash value as
input and uses a GPU to quickly try every possible combination of characters until it
finds a match. The program could then be used to demonstrate the weakness of the
MD5 encryption scheme by showing how quickly it can be broken using a brute-force
attack. Overall, this project highlights the significance of using stronger and more
secure encryption methods to protect sensitive data.

## 1 Problem Statement

The MD5 algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hashing algorithm that is used to
verify the integrity of data. You may have seen an MD5 hash provided with a large file
download in order to confirm package validity. In the past, MD5 has seen usage in database
password encryption due to its relatively simple and fast algorithm. Unfortunately, its susceptibility to brute force attacks is a major security concern and one of the reasons it is
discouraged from being used by Cryptographers.

A brute force attack is a type of attack that attempts to exhaustively try all possible
combinations of characters until the correct one is found. Due to the sheer number of possible combinations, a brute-force attack on an MD5 hash can be extremely time-consuming.
However, with the availability of powerful parallel GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) systems,
attackers can perform brute force attacks at much faster speeds. By utilizing a large number
of threads available on a GPU, attackers can drastically reduce the amount of time needed
to complete a brute-force attack.

In addition to the increased speed of brute force attacks, the MD5 algorithm has also
been found to be susceptible to collisions. This means that two different inputs can produce
the same hash, giving attackers the ability to generate valid hashes for a given input without
actually knowing the input itself.

The combination of increased attack speed and susceptibility to collisions has made MD
an increasingly insecure hashing algorithm. As such, many developers and organizations
have started to move away from using MD5. Alternatives such as SHA-256, SHA-3, and
BLAKE2 are considered more secure and are recommended for use instead.[Wik22]

I hope to demonstrate how effective the brute-force approach is by utilizing the maximum
performance from modern GPU computing. We will analyze the duration to determine the
real-world feasibility of this approach.


## 2 Solution Description

In my implementation of this brute force algorithm, I had to make some design decisions.
When approaching this project I had several questions and choices.

1. How can I ensure no two threads ever attempt the same string?
2. How can I select only alphanumeric characters for my string?
3. How do I generate all permutations of an n-digit password?
4. Is there some way to avoid creating a string before proceeding with the MD5 algorithm?
5. How can I leverage shared memory to reduce overall computation?
6. What are the optimal block and grid dimensions?
7. Is it better to convert an integer into a string with conditionals or to load from shared
    memory?

My conclusions were:

1. By using thread id + iteration * block * grid dimensions for successive computations.
2. & 3 by creating a character set of valid characters and accessing them through indices.
4. I believe it is not possible since MD5 depends on the correct character values for its
    algorithmic calculations.
5. Load character set and the secret hash into shared memory since those are constant
    across all threads. Potentially keep a shared block-wide substring (depending on kernel
    dimensions).
6. I found that working with multiples of 32 and close to the length of the character set
    (in our case length = 62) resulted in the best performance, but this is dependent on
    the answers to the other questions answered previously.
7. I was unable to test this due to time constraints, but it is something that I would
    consider experimenting with in the future.

I implemented the MD5 algorithm twice. Once as a C++ library and second as a CUDA
library. I didn’t realize that using C++ classes in device code would cause the compiler to
throw so many errors.

This resource [Riv92] provided much of the logic and implementation. It needed slight
adjustments for C++ and CUDA 64-bit systems.

## 3 Overview of results. Demonstration of your project

Once I cleaned up all of the bugs, I ran the cracker for multiple sample hashes to test for
correctness and get timing data. All data comes from the GTX 1080 provided by WACC on
Euler. The sustained hash rate of this algorithm is **1,120 Mh/s**. 
The y-axis of the graph is logarithmic to better represent the relationship between String and Time.

Figure 2: Runtime table

Although I was unable to time test how long it
takes to crack all 7-digit passwords (string ’zzzzzzz’,
due to Euler time limitation), with the knowledge it
takes 1 minute to attempt all 6-digits password combinations we can estimate that it will take a little over 1
hour to attempt all permutations from 1 through 7 digits.

Considering that these hashes need to be calculated only
once, if you save the generated hashes in a lookup table then
this is a very viable crack, even for salted hash databases given
you know the salt.

## 4 Deliverables

Alongside this write-up, important files in the repo are

1. cracker.cu – contains brute force thread implementation
2. cracker.cuh – contains brute force thread implementation
3. main.cu – runs cracker
4. makefile – compiles and runs the project
5. md5.cuh – MD5 algorithm CUDA implementation & thread id−→string algorithm
6. md5.cpp – MD5 algorithm C++ implementation
7. md5.h – MD5 algorithm C++ implementation

There is only one executable produced from all of these files, which ismainand it requires no additional data dependencies.

Compilation:

make compile

Run on local machine:

# To crack a specific hash
```
./main <your hash here>
```

# Or enter string to convert to hash to crack
```
./main
> string prompt: <your string here>
```

# Running predefined test hashes
```
make test
```

You can modify test.sh to change what gets run on Euler.

# Running predefined test hashes in test.sh on Euler
```
make test_euler
```


## 5 Conclusions and Future Work

I see a lot of room for optimization and improvements with my implementation.

In my implementation, I convert a thread’s id into a string and then run the MD5 algorithm. If we pick our block dims correctly (blockDim = length of character set), we can share a block string and simply concatenate it with the thread id-specific character. I tried
implementing this but I ran into a bug, so I reverted to my working algorithm.

Since this task scales very well horizontally, another improvement would be requesting
multiple GPUs for a multi-device effort. No data would need to be exchanged between the
devices, they would just need to know of each others’ existence, basically outright multiplying the hash rate.

Another place of improvement can be with the conditionals. If I can reduce the if statements in the thread loop then I can reduce the accumulating warp divergence. Since there
are millions of hashes being run, these seemingly small costs add up over time.

Finally, one issue with this project is that increasing the kernel dimensions causes the
algorithm to get stuck. I am not sure why this occurs and would debug this issue in the
future as plenty of computational power is wasted by not using all of the resources available
on the device.

Some of the skills I acquired from the course material of ECE759 that were used in
this project include shared memory, loading data in parallel, device synchronization, warp
synchronization, and thread divergence. Not all of these were implemented, but they were
considered in implementation decision-making.

One takeaway from this project is that when designing high-performance applications,
one cannot rely on a theoretically better implementation for performance benefits. One of
my number-to-string algorithm implementations was theoretically superior to the current
implementation but it actually scaled relatively poorly. Another takeaway is that seemingly
cheap operations can have a really big overhead cost attached to them. You need to consider
all associated costs with an operation. For example, if I decided to do arithmetic offset to
map an index to a valid character instead of a load instruction, the offset approach could
be faster, but the overhead cost of the conditional statement required to pull off the offset
could add unwanted divergence.

With strong advancements in GPU & ASIC computing, I believe many algorithms we
currently think are unfeasible to brute force may actually be susceptible.
